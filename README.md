<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Sigita :woman:</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Junior Full Stack developer from Lithuania üá±üáπ living in the UK üá¨üáß</h3>

<p align="left"> I am an ambitious and dedicated Junior Full Stack Developer, looking for a role where I can share my experience and expand my programming knowledge in a supportive and junior-friendly environment.
  
I have recently completed <a href="https://www.makers.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Makers Academy</a>, an immersive 16 weeks software development bootcamp where I strengthened my previous coding knowledge to the level where I can proudly say that I am ready for my first role in this industry.

Over the period in UK, working through multiple different jobs and industries trying to figure out which path to follow, I learned a lot about myself - what I am good at and what my flaws are. These factors and constant research ultimately led me to what I think I really enjoy, which is coding. I love coding and I love the feeling after you complete a challenge or a project you were working on for a period of time. I would like to think I have enough discipline which makes it easier for me to keep learning something new every day. Although, there are some days when I feel frustrated, I do not give up and this offers me motivation to carry on.</p>

<h1 align="left">Skills:</h1>
<p><strong>Detail-oriented :ear:</strong><br>I believe that detail-oriented person is a good listener and very organized. During my time in Readie Construction I was constantly taking meeting minutes to ensure that all the employees knows what decisions were made at the meeting and who is going to carry them out.
At Makers Academy I was always trying to catch mistakes before running tests to minimise the list of errors (e.g. finding typos or brackets in the wrong place).</p>
<p><strong>Planning :calendar:</strong><br>I like to think about the future. Usually trying to finnish tasks before the due date so I could relax and calmly concentrate on the next assignment. During my time at the coding bootcamp I was constantly trying to organise my personal time to carry out responsibilities, i.e., attempting or setting up a plan for my weekend homework on Friday so that my time spent during weekend challenges would be organized and the proccess would be as smooth as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment :computer:</strong><br> I've started to self-learn coding more than a year ago and completed the 4 months of Makers Academy coding bootcamp as a remote student. This required discipline, focus and self motivation.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptable and Quick learner :open_hands:</strong><br>I used to live and work in Lithuamia, Spain and UK where I was able to adapt to the new environments at ease and without any difficulty. Furthermore, I am able to grasp new concepts quickly and efficiently, i.e., during my bootcamp course (week 8-9), we successfully built our group's engineering project in Ruby on Rails framework without prior knowledge and within limited timeframe. </p>
<p><strong>Teamwork :busts_in_silhouette:</strong><br>Working in hospitality industry has led me to become a good team player. I was working with the group of different people to achieve a shared goal which was ensuring our customers remain happy. This required collaboration, excellent communication, time management and attentiveness. Moreover, I believe that my time at Makers has also given me valuable experience working as part of a team since practically every day was spent pair-programming. Additiionally, we had 3 group engineering projects which I believe prepared me for a work world in tech where teamwork and collaboration are the norm. </p>
<strong>Additional skills :heavy_plus_sign:</strong><ul><li>Methodologies: Test Driven Development, Agile, Object Oriented Programming.</li><li>Foreign languages: Fluent written and spoken Lithuanian/English and basic Spanish.</li></ul>
